**I decided to take this course for two reasons:**  

* I'm interested in learning more about the possibilities that open data offers.  
* I thought that taking this course would be a good way to refresh my knowledge about Git and GitHub.  

I heard about this course from friends.

Setting up all of the needed tools for this course sounded like a difficult task at first, but it turned out to be easier than I had expected.
